# RedDeadBugged
Description:

    This repository is dedicated to tracking and documenting gameplay bugs, glitches, and unexpected behaviors found during my Red Dead Redemption 2 playthrough.

    As an aspiring QA Game Tester, I created this log to showcase my bug detection, documentation, and testing approach while playing one of the most detailed open-world games ever made by Rockstar Games.

    Each bug report is well-structured with titles, steps to reproduce, platform details, expected vs. actual results, and visual references (if available).
